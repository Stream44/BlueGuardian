AI-assisted security assessment and remediation workflow tool validated against the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).

The tool helps teams systematically reduce risk rather than just generating findings by connecting discovery and understanding to remediation.

1. Loads documents such as:

 * [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/2025/)
 * [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
 * [The OWASP Testing Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/)

2. Generates a structured knowledge graph to drive **learning**, **audit**, **reporting** and **remediation** processes.

From the graph the tool:

1. Projects (realtime renders from the graph) a **navigable synthesis of all documents**.

2. Generates **technical interactive visualizations** to explain security concepts.

3. Projects an **executable audit plan** with an API to intergate with AI agent systems or manual investigation workflows

4. Projects an **audit report** and associated **executable remediation plan** with an API to intergate with AI agent systems or manual investigation workflows

5. Projects **application security health scores** to celebrate achievements.
